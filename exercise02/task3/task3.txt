Experiment with different values for n and s. Analyze the obtained output. 

Is the order of the messages consistent? 
No

Can the order of these messages be predicted?
No

What does it depend on?
What the sceduler selects. One factor could be priority, but it is same.

Notice that the function DR_p uses rand(3) to repeatedly generate pseudo-random numbers.
By default, this function returns the same sequence of numbers every time. 
To get different estimates from each process, seed the random number generator using srand(getpid()). 
Does it matter whether you do this before or after the call to fork()?

Yes, seeding after fork() ensures that each process uses 
its unique process ID to initialize its random number 
generator, producing different random sequences.
